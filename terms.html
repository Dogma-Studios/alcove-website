    <p>Welcome! Alcove enables you to build meaningful connections around the joy of playing games and shared interests through voice, video, text, and feed-based features. We’re happy you’re here.</p><p>These terms set forth our legal obligations to each other. They apply to your use of our services.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: </strong>The section titled “Settling Disputes Between You and Dogma Studios” contains an arbitration clause and class-action waiver that applies to all U.S.-based Alcove users. Please read this section carefully as it may significantly affect your legal rights, including your right to file a lawsuit in court.</p><p>When we say “Dogma Studios,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in these terms, we mean Dogma Studios LLC, its subsidiaries, and its related companies.</p><p>When we say “services” in these terms, we mean Alcove’s services, apps, websites, and other products, including the Alcove desktop application, web application, and mobile application.</p><p>When we say “you” or “your,” we mean you. If you’re accessing our services on behalf of a legal entity (like your employer), you agree that you have the authority to bind that entity to these terms, and “you” and “your” will refer to that entity.</p><p>We also have a <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>, <strong>Community Guidelines</strong>, and other policies that apply to your use of our services and are incorporated into these terms. You should read these policies—we’ve worked hard to make them simple and clear, and they contain important information about your use of our services. If you use our APIs or other developer services or software, our Developer Terms of Service and Developer Policy apply to that use. Our Paid Services Terms apply to any purchase you make through Alcove. By using Alcove’s services, you agree to these terms.</p><p>Together, these rules make Alcove possible, and they matter to us. If you believe others aren’t following them, please let us know by reporting it to us.</p><h1>1. Who We Are</h1><p>We’re Dogma Studios! Dogma Studios LLC is the company behind Alcove. Our principal place of business is in the United States. You can reach us at legal@alcove.gg.</p><h1>2. Age Requirements and Responsibility of Parents and Legal Guardians</h1><p>By accessing our services, you confirm that you’re at least 13 years old and meet the minimum age required by the laws in your country. Our services are not designed for nor directed towards users under the age of 13. We may take additional steps, including the use of third-party services, to determine whether you are old enough to create an Alcove account or access certain features or spaces.</p><p>By creating an Alcove account or using our services, you accept and agree to be bound by these terms and represent that you have either reached the age of “majority” where you live or your parent or legal guardian agrees to be bound by these terms on your behalf. If you do not know whether you have reached the age of majority where you live, or do not understand this section, please ask your parent or legal guardian for help and ask them to read these terms with you.</p><p>If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child (who must meet the minimum age for your country) to use the services, then you and the minor child accept and agree to be bound by these terms and are responsible for all use of the Alcove account or services, including your child’s activity on the services and purchases made by them, whether the minor’s account is now open or created later.</p><h1>3. What You Can Expect from Us</h1><p>Alcove provides services that help you connect with other Alcove users and communities. Alcove users communicate primarily via “Rooms,” which are digital spaces made up of different types of channels. Text channels allow users to interact via text-based messages, as well as images, GIFs, emoji, and other uploadable media. Voice channels allow users to communicate by voice and/or streaming video. Users can also communicate one-to-one using direct messages, or communicate with a limited number of users via group direct messages.</p><p>Alcove also features Feed channels, which provide Reddit-style post and comment functionality within Rooms. Users can create posts, comment on posts, and engage in threaded discussions. Users may also utilize “Keep &amp; Shelves,” a personal bookmarking and content organization system. We’re always evolving our services, and we may create other types of spaces and features in the future.</p><p>Users create Rooms, and users choose which Rooms to join and who their “friends” are. All users must follow our Community Guidelines and other policies, but in Rooms, the Room owners and admins control the Room permissions and additional rules, including establishing membership requirements and creating custom roles and what those roles can do within the Room. Room owners and admins also control whether to make their Room available in discovery features, whether to publish their Room invite link on public websites, whether to enable community growth and safety features, and whether to add integrations or other apps. These permissions, like the size of a Room, may change over time.</p><p>Alcove is designed to make communicating with the people you want to speak to as easy as possible. Posts appear in text channels in the order in which they’re made. Voice and video communication happens in real time. We may build features that help you create content, communicate with others, discover or access content or third-party services, or join conversations more easily, or may highlight content and activity available to you on Alcove that might be of interest.</p><p>Alcove’s services may be personalized to each user based on a variety of factors, including their activity, preferences they identified in their Settings, and Rooms they belong to, so that you can see content and communities that may be of interest to you. You can control whether and to what extent Alcove personalizes your experience in your Settings.</p><p>Alcove takes user safety seriously. We provide features and services that are designed to help keep users safe. Certain features and settings may have different defaults depending on your age or where you live, and some may not be optional at all.</p><p>We’re actively developing new features and products to improve Alcove. As part of these efforts, we may add or remove features, start offering new services, or stop offering some services entirely (or just in some places or for some users) if they no longer make sense from a business perspective or create risk for Dogma Studios, our users, or other third parties. While we try to avoid disruptions, we cannot guarantee that there will not be an outage or change to the services, and your content may not be retrievable due to such outages or changes. We are not liable for any such outages or service changes.</p><h1>4. Your Alcove Account</h1><p>To access the services on an ongoing basis, you will need to create an Alcove account. You can provide a username and password, and a way of contacting you (such as an email address and/or phone number). You’ll also need to provide your birthday. In some cases, you may be required to verify your account or provide additional information.</p><p>You are responsible for the security of your account, and you agree to notify us immediately if you believe your account has been compromised. If you use a password, it must be strong, and we strongly recommend that you use that password only for your Alcove account and that you enable two-factor authentication.</p><p>You must always provide accurate information to Dogma Studios and maintain the accuracy of the information associated with your account. We may assume that any communications we’ve received from your account or the associated contact information have been made by you, and that any purchases made using your account were made by you.</p><p>If you get locked out of your account, we’ll need to contact you at the email or phone number associated with your account. If your account is compromised or you no longer have access to your email account or phone number, we may not be able to restore your access to your account or the Rooms you’ve created.</p><p>You agree not to license, sell, lend, or transfer your account, Alcove username, vanity URL, or other unique identifier without our prior written approval. We also reserve the right to delete, change, or reclaim your username, URL, or other identifier.</p><h1>5. Content in Alcove’s Services</h1><h2>Your Content</h2><p>When we say “your content” in these terms, we mean all the things you add (upload, post, share, stream, etc.) to our services. This includes text, links, GIFs, emoji, photos, videos, documents, feed posts, comments, or other media. If we come up with another way for you to add content to the services, it includes that too.</p><p>You don’t have any obligation to add content to the services. If you choose to add content to the services, you are responsible for ensuring that you have the right to do so, that you have the right to grant the licenses in this section of these terms, and that your content is lawful. We take no responsibility for any of your content, and we are not responsible for others’ use of your content.</p><p>Our services allow users to add content in a number of different ways, including via direct messages, group direct messages, and in small and large Rooms. Some of these Rooms may be larger spaces, and if you share content within them, that content may be more likely to be accessed by a lot of people. You should be aware that these permissions are set by Room owners or admins, and they may change over time. Please understand where you are posting on Alcove, familiarize yourself with the relevant Room permissions when joining and posting in a certain space, and choose the right space, features, and settings for you and your content.</p><p>Your content is yours, but you give us a license (which is a form of permission) to it when you use Alcove. Your content may be protected by certain intellectual property rights. We don’t own those. But by using our services, you grant us a license to use, reproduce, distribute, create derivative works of, display, and perform your content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of providing, developing, and improving our services as permitted by applicable laws. This license is worldwide, non-exclusive (which means you can still license your content to others), royalty-free (which means there are no fees for this license), sublicensable, and transferable. Learn more about how we use your content in our Privacy Policy.</p><p>We reserve the right to block, remove, and/or permanently delete your content if we determine it is in breach of these terms, our Community Guidelines, our other policies, or any applicable law or regulation, or if it creates risk for Dogma Studios or negatively impacts the experience or interests of other Alcove users to continue to make it available. You agree that we may disclose your content to third parties outside of the services when we believe we’re required to do so by law or regulation or that doing so is necessary to prevent harm to a person or to protect Dogma Studios’ rights and property.</p><p>We welcome feedback on our services. By sending us feedback, you grant us a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable license to use the feedback and ideas generated from the feedback without any restrictions, attribution, or compensation to you.</p><h2>Dogma Studios’ Content</h2><p>Our services include some content that belongs to us, such as the design of our apps and websites, our art and images, and content written by us. You may use our software as outlined in these terms. You may only use our trademarks (or other brand indicia) and copyrights as permitted in our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission. We retain all intellectual property rights in our content.</p><h2>Other Content</h2><p><em>Other people’s content. </em>Our services might also provide you with access to other people’s content. You may not use this content without that person’s consent, or as allowed by law. Other people’s content is theirs and doesn’t necessarily reflect Dogma Studios’ own views. Dogma Studios doesn’t endorse or verify the accuracy or reliability of content shared by Alcove users. We work hard to try to make Alcove a safe, positive, and inclusive place, but cannot always prevent you from encountering content that you may find objectionable or offensive. You agree we will not be liable for any harm caused by that content. You may report content that you think violates any of our policies. We have the right, but not the obligation, to review such reports and block or remove content at our discretion.</p><p><em>Third-party features and content. </em>Our services may also contain links to or allow you to access third-party websites, features, apps, or other content. We are not responsible for the content or services available from these third parties.</p><h1>6. Software in Alcove’s Services</h1><p><em>License to our software. </em>Some of our services allow you to download client software (including our desktop application for Windows, macOS, and Linux, and our mobile applications). So long as you comply with these terms, we grant you a worldwide, non-exclusive, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and non-assignable license to download, install, and run that software, solely to access our services.</p><p>You may not copy, modify, create derivative works based upon, distribute, sell, lease, or sublicense any of our software or services. You also may not reverse engineer or decompile our software or services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so, unless you have our written consent or applicable law permits it.</p><p>Although we are granting you this license, we retain any intellectual property rights we have in our software and services.</p><p><em>Open source. </em>Some of Alcove’s services include software subject to separate open source license terms, and your use of those services is subject to your compliance with those license terms, when applicable. We encourage you to review them, as some licenses may explicitly override these terms.</p><p><em>Third-party services. </em>Alcove may allow you to access apps, integrations, or other products, features, or services developed by third parties (“third-party services”). It’s your choice whether to use these third-party services and whether to participate in Alcove Rooms or other spaces that incorporate them. You should review any terms and policies provided by the third parties before doing so as they govern your use of their services. Dogma Studios is not responsible for any third-party services.</p><h1>7. Copyright</h1><p>We respect the intellectual property of others and expect our users to do the same. If you believe that your copyrighted work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement and is accessible on our services, please notify us in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). You may submit a DMCA notice to our designated agent at legal@alcove.gg.</p><h1>8. Alcove’s Paid Services</h1><p>We won’t charge you a fee to use the basic functionality of our services, but you may be able to pay for additional features and products. Our Paid Services Terms also apply to any purchase you make using Alcove’s supported purchase flows, and you may also be asked to agree to separate terms before purchasing or selling new offerings through Alcove.</p><h1>9. Restrictions on Your Use of Alcove’s Services</h1><p>When using our services, you must comply with these terms and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and you must only use the services for authorized and acceptable purposes. You must also adhere to our Community Guidelines and other policies, which contain more detailed rules about your content and behavior when using Alcove and how we enforce them on Alcove.</p><p>Fundamentally, do not do, try to do, or encourage or help others to do any of the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Don’t use the services to do harm to yourself or others. </strong>Among other things, this includes trying to gain access to another user’s account or any non-public portions of the services; infringing anyone else’s intellectual property rights or any other proprietary rights; exploiting, harassing, bullying, spamming, auto-messaging, or auto-dialing people through our services; and using our services to plan or cause real-world harm to someone else.</li><li><strong>Don’t use the services to do harm to Alcove. </strong>Among other things, this includes trying to gain access to, intentionally overburdening, or attacking our systems; scraping our services without our written consent, including by using any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or other automatic device, process, or software; selling, licensing, or otherwise commercializing content or data obtained from our services; transmitting viruses or other malicious code to our services; using any unauthorized software designed to modify the services; abusing or defrauding us or our payment systems; copying, dismantling, or reverse engineering any of our services or using our intellectual property without permission; and misusing our reporting or customer service mechanisms.</li><li><strong>Don’t use the services to do anything else that’s illegal. </strong>This includes using the services to plan or commit any crime or do anything else that is illegal.</li></ul><p>We encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe violates these restrictions. <strong>If you or someone else is in immediate danger, please contact your local law enforcement agency. Please note that you cannot contact law enforcement or other emergency services via our services.</strong></p><h1>10. Term and Termination</h1><p><strong>Your right to terminate. </strong>You’re free to stop using Alcove’s services at any time and for any reason. To terminate this agreement, you may delete your Alcove account through the Settings page in the Alcove app and discontinue use of the services. Certain provisions of these terms will survive termination as outlined below in the “Survival” section.</p><p>Disabling your account limits the processing of your personal information as described in our Privacy Policy. Disabling your account does not terminate this agreement.</p><p><strong>Our right to terminate. </strong>Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account and/or your access to some or all of our services with or without notice, at our discretion for any reason, or for the following reasons:</p><ul><li>You breach, or you encourage or help others to breach, these terms (including our Community Guidelines, our other policies, or additional terms that apply to specific services).</li><li>We’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or court order.</li><li>We reasonably believe termination is necessary to prevent harm to you, us, other users, or third parties.</li><li>Your account has been inactive for more than two years.</li><li>Continuing to allow your account to be active, giving you access to some or all services, or hosting your content creates risk for Dogma Studios, other users, or third parties.</li></ul><p>However, we will give you advance notice if reasonable to do so or required by applicable law.</p><h1>11. Appeals</h1><p>We value transparency and work hard to give you context for the decisions we make. You can appeal any enforcement action we take under these terms or other policies, including terminations, suspensions, or content removals by contacting us at appeals@alcove.gg or through available in-app options.</p><h1>12. Indemnity</h1><p>You will indemnify and hold Dogma Studios and its officers, directors, employees, members, and agents harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, and costs (including reasonable legal and accounting fees) related to (a) your access to or use of our services or third-party services, (b) your content, (c) your violation of these terms, or (d) your negligence or willful misconduct.</p><h1>13. Services “AS IS”</h1><p>We work hard to offer great services, but we can’t guarantee any minimum levels of quality of services (which may also depend on factors beyond our control, such as the quality of your internet access and equipment).</p><p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DOGMA STUDIOS LLC, ITS AFFILIATES, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SUPPLIERS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS.” WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. THE LAWS OF CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS OR STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES. TO THE EXTENT SUCH WARRANTIES CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED UNDER THE LAWS OF YOUR JURISDICTION, WE LIMIT THE DURATION AND REMEDIES OF SUCH WARRANTIES TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER THOSE LAWS.</p><h1>14. Data Charges</h1><p>You are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using our services. This includes data charges and charges for messaging, such as SMS, MMS, or other messaging protocols or technologies. If you are not sure what you may be charged, you should ask your mobile service provider before using our services.</p><h1>15. Limitation of Liability</h1><p>WE DON’T EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO SO. IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE BELOW TYPES OF EXCLUSIONS AREN’T ALLOWED, WE’RE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL OR OUR MATERIAL BREACH OF OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU.

Settling Disputes Between You and Dogma Studios</h1><p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE OR PARTICIPATE IN A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND LIMITING YOUR RIGHTS TO RESOLVE YOUR DISPUTE AS PART OF A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.</p><p><strong>This section applies to any and all disputes between you and Dogma Studios. </strong>“Disputes” means all disagreements between us including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, these terms, or your use of the services, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory (each a “Dispute” and collectively “Disputes”).</p><h2>Informal Dispute Resolution</h2><p>Most Disputes can be resolved informally. If you have an issue with the services or Dogma Studios, you agree that you will reach out to us and use good faith efforts to settle the Dispute informally through negotiation before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. This requires emailing disputes@alcove.gg a written notice (“Written Notice”) about your issue, which must include: (1) your name; (2) the email address or phone number associated with your Alcove account; (3) a detailed description of the issue; and (4) how you’d like to resolve it.</p><p>If the Dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of the Written Notice, you and Dogma Studios agree to resolve any remaining Dispute through further informal discussions or one of the formal dispute resolution provisions below.</p><p>This Informal Dispute Resolution process is a prerequisite and condition precedent to commencing any formal dispute resolution proceeding. You and Dogma Studios (the “Parties”) agree that any applicable statute of limitations period and filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled while the Parties engage in this Informal Dispute Resolution process.</p><h2>Governing Law, Jurisdiction, Class Action Waiver and Time Limitation</h2><p><strong>Choice of Law. </strong>These terms and all Disputes between you and Dogma Studios, whether in arbitration or court, shall be governed by the law of the United States and the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflicts of law provisions.</p><p><strong>Venue and Jurisdiction. </strong>By agreeing to these terms, you and Dogma Studios agree that to the extent any Dispute is not arbitrable, the Dispute must be resolved exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction, federal or state (including small claims court), located in New Castle County, Delaware, and no other court. You and Dogma Studios consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction over you by such courts with respect to any such Dispute.</p><p><strong>Class Action Waiver. </strong>You agree that any Dispute between you and Dogma Studios that for any reason is not subject to the “Agreement to Arbitrate” section below may only be pursued by you on an individual basis, and you may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, collective, or representative action.</p><p><strong>Time for Initiating a Claim. </strong>No action, regardless of form, arising out of or relating to a Dispute may be brought by either Party more than one (1) year after the cause of action has accrued.</p><h2>Agreement to Arbitrate (U.S. Residents)</h2><p>IF YOU’RE A U.S. RESIDENT YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</p><p>Only after engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution process set forth in these Terms, and only after those efforts fail to resolve the Dispute, then either Party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve Disputes, subject to the terms of this Agreement to Arbitrate.</p><p>You and Dogma Studios agree that this Agreement to Arbitrate is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16.</p><p>This Agreement to Arbitrate is intended to be interpreted broadly, and it applies to all Disputes between the Parties, including claims that arose before the existence of this Agreement to Arbitrate or any prior agreement, and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement to Arbitrate.</p><p>ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. IN SOME INSTANCES, THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION COULD EXCEED THE COSTS OF LITIGATION AND THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY MAY BE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION THAN IN COURT. YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND DOGMA STUDIOS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p><p><strong>Arbitration Rules. </strong>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) or another mutually agreed-upon arbitration provider. Except as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate, the provider will administer the arbitration in accordance with its applicable rules and procedures in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed, excluding any rules or procedures permitting class or representative actions.</p><p><strong>Arbitration Costs. </strong>If Dogma Studios is the Party initiating an arbitration against you, Dogma Studios will pay all costs associated with the arbitration, including the entire filing fee. If you initiate an arbitration against Dogma Studios, costs will be determined in accordance with the Rules for the applicable arbitration provider, to the extent allowed by law.</p><p><strong>Arbitration Decision. </strong>The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding on you and Dogma Studios, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>Opt-out. </strong>You can decline this Agreement to Arbitrate—and no other provision of these terms—by emailing an opt-out notice to arbitration-opt-out@alcove.gg within 30 days of January 1, 2026 or when you first register your Alcove account, whichever is later; otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate Disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs.</p><p><strong>Exceptions. </strong>You or Dogma Studios may still pursue claims, if they qualify, exclusively in a small claims court in the United States on an individual basis for Disputes and actions within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction. Additionally, Disputes concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of our services will not be subject to arbitration.</p><p><strong>Class Arbitration and Collective Relief Waiver. </strong>IF YOU’RE A U.S. RESIDENT, UNLESS DOGMA STUDIOS AGREES OTHERWISE IN A SEPARATE WRITING, YOU AND DOGMA STUDIOS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p><h1>17. More Important Stuff</h1><p>You have certain rights that, by law, can’t be limited by these terms, and we in no way intend to restrict those rights in these terms. The term “including” as used in these terms means “including without limitation.”</p><p><strong>Entire agreement. </strong>These terms cover the entire agreement between you and Dogma Studios for your use of our services.</p><p><strong>Additional terms. </strong>Where additional terms apply to our products or services, the additional terms will control with respect to your use of that product or service to the extent of any conflict with these terms.</p><p><strong>Bug reporting. </strong>We support the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. To report a security issue, please email security@alcove.gg.</p><p><strong>Export Control. </strong>You agree to comply with all applicable import, export, and re-export control laws and restrictions, including but not limited to those of the European Union and its member states, the U.S. Department of Commerce Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) and economic sanctions maintained by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”), and will not use the services to cause a violation of such laws or regulations.

If any part of these terms ends up being invalid or unenforceable based on a decision by any court or competent authority, the rest of these terms will not be affected. You may not assign these terms to anyone else without our written consent. We may assign our rights to any of our affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with our services.</p><p><strong>Survival. </strong>Any part of these terms that by their nature should survive after termination of these terms will survive. As permitted under applicable law, this includes but may not be limited to the following: our rights to retain and display certain data; any amounts owed will remain due; any indemnification obligations such as those listed under the “Indemnity” section; any disclaimer of warranties such as those under the “Services ‘AS IS’” section; any applicable limitation of liability such as those under the “Limitation of Liability” section; and any dispute resolution provisions, including the arbitration agreement, such as those under the “Settling Disputes Between You and Dogma Studios” section.</p><p><strong>Updates to these terms. </strong>We may decide to update these terms: (1) to reflect changes to our services or our business, (2) for legal or regulatory reasons, (3) to prevent abuse on or of our services, or (4) to better protect or serve users of our services. If these changes materially affect your Alcove use or your legal rights, we’ll give you reasonable advance notice (unless the updates are urgent).
